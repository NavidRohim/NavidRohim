Hi, I’m Navid

Currently maintainer for JMWS, a mod for Minecraft!

I'm interested in hardware at the moment and lower level programming. Currently learning Java though.
If you need anything please join my discord, if it's an issue regarding JMWS please make a GitHub issue.

Also, excuse my demeanor. I am autistic and conversing with people doesn't come naturally to me. I usually have to try very hard.
